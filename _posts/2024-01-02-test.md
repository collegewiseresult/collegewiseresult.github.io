# Introduction

Rooting your Android device provides you with administrative access to the Android operating system, allowing you to unlock additional features, customize your device, and install powerful apps that require root access.

Whether you're a novice user or an experienced Android enthusiast, this guide will provide you with step-by-step instructions and valuable insights to help you root your Android device safely and effectively.

## Part 1: Rooting with a PC

- Enable "USB Debugging."

### Step 2: Install USB Drivers

## Part 2: Rooting Without a PC

Rooting your Android device without a PC involves using apps or exploits that exploit vulnerabilities in the Android system to gain root access. This method is convenient but may have limitations depending on your device model and Android version. Here's how to root your Android device without a PC:

### Step 5: Run Rooting App
